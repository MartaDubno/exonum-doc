# Service with Data Proofs

This tutorial is an extended version of the
[service creation tutorial](create-service.md).
It shows how to create cryptographic proofs for data in Exonum
and how to organize the corresponding data layout.

In this Exonum service we implement a cryptocurrency,
which allows the following operations:

- creating a wallet
- replenishing the wallet balance
- transferring money between wallets
- obtaining [cryptographic proofs](../architecture/storage.md#merkelized-indices)
  of executed transactions
- reviewing wallets history.

You can view and download the full source code of this tutorial [here][demo].

!!! tip
    We suggest that you try to launch the simpler service first before proceeding
    with this tutorial as some
    steps are omitted here for the sake of smooth exposition.

Unlike its predecessor, the tutorial contains a [client part][demo-frontend],
which provides for interaction with the service.

## Create Rust Project

To build the service you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
and the latest version of
[Rust](https://rustup.rs/) compiler installed on your PC.

Create a crate with the **exonum** crate as a dependency.

```sh
cargo new cryptocurrency-advanced
```

Add necessary dependencies to `Cargo.toml` in the project directory:

```toml
[dependencies]
exonum = "0.9.0"
exonum-configuration = "0.9.0"
serde = "1.0"
serde_derive = "1.0"
failure = "=0.1.1"
```

Then import said dependencies into `src/lib.rs` file. We will use them to fetch
the necessary structures, functions, types, traits etc.:

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate exonum;
#[macro_use]
extern crate failure;
extern crate serde;
#[macro_use]
extern crate serde_derive;
```

For convenience reasons we decided to divide the code into 4 submodules, each
corresponding to a certain part of the
service business logic. Let’s announce them below:

```rust
pub mod api;
pub mod schema;
pub mod transactions;
pub mod wallet;
```

## Constants

Let’s define the constants to be used further:

```rust
/// Unique service ID.
const CRYPTOCURRENCY_SERVICE_ID: u16 = 128;
/// Name of the service.
pub const SERVICE_NAME: &str = "cryptocurrency";
/// Initial balance of the wallet.
const INITIAL_BALANCE: u64 = 100;
```

Implement a service structure and realize a trait for it with all the necessary
methods and credentials:

??? "Service definition"
    ```rust
    #[derive(Default, Debug)]
    pub struct CurrencyService;

    impl Service for CurrencyService {
        fn service_name(&self) -> &str {
            SERVICE_NAME
        }

        fn service_id(&self) -> u16 {
            CRYPTOCURRENCY_SERVICE_ID
        }

        // Indicate the way the state hash of the database is calculated.
        fn state_hash(&self, view: &dyn Snapshot) -> Vec<Hash> {
            let schema = CurrencySchema::new(view);
            schema.state_hash()
        }

        // Interface to create transactions from raw data.
        fn tx_from_raw(
            &self,
            raw: RawTransaction
        ) -> Result<Box<dyn Transaction>, EncodingError> {
            WalletTransactions::tx_from_raw(raw).map(Into::into)
        }

        // Indicate public API.
        fn wire_api(&self, builder: &mut ServiceApiBuilder) {
            api::CryptocurrencyApi::wire(builder);
        }
    }
    ```

Unlike in previous tutorial where node configuration was realized manually, in
the advanced tutorial we implement a
trait that allows us to launch the project with the help of `NodeBuilder`.
`NodeBuilder` is an abstract that allows to
easily configure a node for launching. In our case it is responsible for
the network setup.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct ServiceFactory;

impl fabric::ServiceFactory for ServiceFactory {
    fn service_name(&self) -> &str {
        SERVICE_NAME
    }

    fn make_service(&mut self, _: &Context) -> Box<dyn Service> {
        Box::new(CurrencyService)
    }
}
```

## Declare Persistent Data

Similarly to a simple cryptocurrency demo we need to declare the data that we
will store in our blockchain, i.e. the `Wallet` type:

```rust
encoding_struct! {
    struct Wallet {
        pub_key:            &PublicKey,
        name:               &str,
        balance:            u64,
        history_len:        u64,
        history_hash:       &Hash,
    }
}
```

As you can see, apart from the already known fields (public key, owner’s name,
balance), the new wallet type stores
the **length of the wallet history** and its **hash**. These data are required
to link the wallet history to the blockchain state hash.

We also realize an auxiliary method for the `Wallet` structure. The method
simultaneously updates the balance and the history of the wallet:

```rust
impl Wallet {
    /// Returns a copy of this wallet with the updated balance.
    pub fn set_balance(self, balance: u64, history_hash: &Hash) -> Self {
        Self::new(
            self.pub_key(),
            self.name(),
            balance,
            self.history_len() + 1,
            history_hash,
        )
    }
}
```

This method is *immutable*; it consumes the old instance of the wallet and
produces a new instance with the
modified `balance` field. It is called within mutable methods allowing
manipulations with the Wallet that will be
specified below.

### Create Schema

As we already mentioned in the simple cryptocurrency tutorial schema is a
structured view of the [key-value storage](../architecture/storage.md)
used in Exonum. We will use the same `Snapshot` and `Fork` abstractions – for
read requests and transactions
correspondingly – to interact with the schema.

Declare schema as a generic wrapper to make it operable with both types of
storage views:

```rust
/// Database schema for cryptocurrency.
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct CurrencySchema<T> {
    view: T,
}
```

In this demo we will generate cryptographic proofs of availability of
certain data in the blockchain,
so `ProofMapIndex` and `ProofListIndex` will be used to store data instead
of  `MapIndex` and `ListIndex`:

<!-- markdownlint-disable no-inline-html -->
??? "Schema definition"
    ```rust
    impl<T> CurrencySchema<T>
    where
        T: AsRef<dyn Snapshot>,
    {
        /// Constructs schema from the database view.
        pub fn new(view: T) -> Self {
            CurrencySchema { view }
        }

        /// Returns `MerklePatriciaTable` with wallets.
        pub fn wallets(&self) -> ProofMapIndex<&T, PublicKey, Wallet> {
            ProofMapIndex::new("cryptocurrency.wallets", &self.view)
        }

        /// Returns history of the wallet with the given public key.
        pub fn wallet_history(
            &self,
            public_key: &PublicKey,
        ) -> ProofListIndex<&T, Hash> {
            ProofListIndex::new_in_family(
                "cryptocurrency.wallet_history",
                public_key,
                &self.view
            )
        }

        /// Returns wallet for the given public key.
        pub fn wallet(&self, pub_key: &PublicKey) -> Option<Wallet> {
            self.wallets().get(pub_key)
        }

        /// Returns state hash of service database.
        pub fn state_hash(&self) -> Vec<Hash> {
            vec![self.wallets().merkle_root()]
        }
    }
    ```
<!-- markdownlint-enable no-inline-html -->

We have added two new getter methods
for wallet history, and the state hash getter, which is required for building
cryptographic proofs.

The mutable methods allow to persist changes caused by transactions
to the service. These
manipulations includes creating a wallet and changing its balance;
in all cases, we additionally record the hash of a transaction
that influenced the balance.

??? "Mutable methods for the schema"
    ```rust
    impl<'a> CurrencySchema<&'a mut Fork> {
        /// Returns mutable `MerklePatriciaTable` with wallets.
        pub fn wallets_mut(
            &mut self,
        ) -> ProofMapIndex<&mut Fork, PublicKey, Wallet> {
            ProofMapIndex::new("cryptocurrency.wallets", &mut self.view)
        }

        /// Returns history for the wallet by the given public key.
        pub fn wallet_history_mut(
            &mut self,
            public_key: &PublicKey,
        ) -> ProofListIndex<&mut Fork, Hash> {
            ProofListIndex::new_in_family(
                "cryptocurrency.wallet_history",
                public_key,
                &mut self.view,
            )
        }

        /// Increases balance of the wallet and appends new record to its history.
        pub fn increase_wallet_balance(
            &mut self,
            wallet: Wallet,
            amount: u64,
            transaction: &Hash,
        ) {
            let wallet = {
                let mut history = self.wallet_history_mut(wallet.pub_key());
                history.push(*transaction);
                let history_hash = history.merkle_root();
                let balance = wallet.balance();
                wallet.set_balance(balance + amount, &history_hash)
            };
            self.wallets_mut().put(wallet.pub_key(), wallet.clone());
        }

        /// Decreases balance of the wallet and appends new record to its history.
        pub fn decrease_wallet_balance(
            &mut self,
            wallet: Wallet,
            amount: u64,
            transaction: &Hash,
        ) {
            let wallet = {
                let mut history = self.wallet_history_mut(wallet.pub_key());
                history.push(*transaction);
                let history_hash = history.merkle_root();
                let balance = wallet.balance();
                wallet.set_balance(balance - amount, &history_hash)
            };
            self.wallets_mut().put(wallet.pub_key(), wallet.clone());
        }

        /// Creates new wallet and appends first record to its history.
        pub fn create_wallet(
            &mut self,
            key: &PublicKey,
            name: &str,
            transaction: &Hash,
        ) {
            let wallet = {
                let mut history = self.wallet_history_mut(key);
                history.push(*transaction);
                let history_hash = history.merkle_root();
                Wallet::new(key, name, INITIAL_BALANCE, history.len(), &history_hash)
            };
            self.wallets_mut().put(key, wallet);
        }
    }
    ```

## Define Transactions

We use `transactions!` macro to define the service transactions.
It unites the transactions under the `WalletTransactions` structure,
which we will use later to refer to any of the defined transactions.

We need three types of transactions; apart from
[the old ones](create-service.md#define-transactions)
(“create a new wallet” and “transfer money between wallets”)
we add a new transaction type that is responsible
for reimbursement of the wallet balance:

```rust
transactions! {
    pub WalletTransactions {
        const SERVICE_ID = CRYPTOCURRENCY_SERVICE_ID;

        struct Transfer {
            from:   &PublicKey,
            to:     &PublicKey,
            amount: u64,
            seed:   u64,
        }

        struct Issue {
            pub_key: &PublicKey,
            amount:  u64,
            seed:    u64,
        }

        struct CreateWallet {
            pub_key: &PublicKey,
            name:    &str,
        }
    }
}
```

The `Issue` transaction type contains the public key of the wallet it reimburses
and applies a `seed` to avoid replay of the transaction.

### Reporting Errors

Before implementing transaction logic we define
the types of errors that might occur
during their execution. The code is identical to the
[one](create-service.md#reporting-errors) in
the simple Cryptocurrency demo.

??? "Error definitions"
    ```rust
    #[derive(Debug, Fail)]
    #[repr(u8)]
    pub enum Error {
        #[fail(display = "Wallet already exists")]
        WalletAlreadyExists = 0,

        #[fail(display = "Sender doesn't exist")]
        SenderNotFound = 1,

        #[fail(display = "Receiver doesn't exist")]
        ReceiverNotFound = 2,

        #[fail(display = "Insufficient currency amount")]
        InsufficientCurrencyAmount = 3,
    }

    impl From<Error> for ExecutionError {
        fn from(value: Error) -> ExecutionError {
            let description = format!("{}", value);
            ExecutionError::with_description(value as u8, description)
        }
    }
    ```

### Transaction Execution

The principle of transaction execution remains the
[same](create-service.md#transaction-execution)
as in the previous tutorial. Namely,
we realize `Transaction` trait with the transaction business logic described
therein for all our transaction types.

The verification logic for `CreateWallet` and `Transfer` transactions
is similar to their predecessors.

??? "CreateWallet transaction"
    ```rust
    impl Transaction for CreateWallet {
        fn verify(&self) -> bool {
            self.verify_signature(self.pub_key())
        }

        fn execute(&self, fork: &mut Fork) -> ExecutionResult {
            let mut schema = CurrencySchema::new(fork);
            let pub_key = self.pub_key();
            let hash = self.hash();

            if schema.wallet(pub_key).is_none() {
                let name = self.name();
                schema.create_wallet(pub_key, name, &hash);
                Ok(())
            } else {
                Err(Error::WalletAlreadyExists)?
            }
        }
    }
    ```

??? "Transfer transaction"
    ```rust
    impl Transaction for Transfer {
        fn verify(&self) -> bool {
            (self.from() != self.to()) && self.verify_signature(self.from())
        }

        fn execute(&self, fork: &mut Fork) -> ExecutionResult {
            let mut schema = CurrencySchema::new(fork);

            let sender = schema.wallet(self.from())
                .ok_or(Error::SenderNotFound)?;
            let receiver = schema.wallet(self.to())
                .ok_or(Error::ReceiverNotFound)?;

            let amount = self.amount();
            if sender.balance() < amount {
                Err(Error::InsufficientCurrencyAmount)?
            }

            let hash = self.hash();
            schema.decrease_wallet_balance(sender, amount, &hash);
            schema.increase_wallet_balance(receiver, amount, &hash);
            Ok(())
        }
    }
    ```

In this tutorial we use dedicated methods to charge
and award money to wallets, so sending money to yourself will not change the
wallet balance. However, we still need to
check that the sender’s balance is larger than the sent amount to complete the
transfer.

The last transaction type is responsible for replenishment of the wallet
balance. Again, we check the signature of the
wallet to be sure we reimburse our own account. We use `increase_wallet_balance`
method to put money to the wallet and
record a new wallet instance into our database:

```rust
impl Transaction for Issue {
    fn verify(&self) -> bool {
        self.verify_signature(self.pub_key())
    }

    fn execute(&self, fork: &mut Fork) -> ExecutionResult {
        let mut schema = CurrencySchema::new(fork);
        let pub_key = self.pub_key();
        let hash = self.hash();

        if let Some(wallet) = schema.wallet(pub_key) {
            let amount = self.amount();
            schema.increase_wallet_balance(wallet, amount, &hash);
            Ok(())
        } else {
            Err(Error::ReceiverNotFound)?
        }
    }
}
```

## Implement API

Next, we need to implement the node API. The API will allow us not only to send
and
obtain the data stored in the blockchain but also will provide proofs of the
correctness of the returned data:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub struct CryptocurrencyApi;
```

### Data Structures

First, we list the structures used by API. We need to define `WalletQuery`
structure which describes what information we
need to pass to the node to get response with information about specific wallet:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq)]
pub struct WalletQuery {
    /// Public key of the queried wallet.
    pub pub_key: PublicKey,
}
```

Besides this we also declare structures that
will be used for processing users’ requests:

??? "Request data objects"
    ```rust
    #[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
    pub struct TransactionResponse {
        /// Hash of the transaction.
        pub tx_hash: Hash,
    }

    /// Proof of existence for specific wallet.
    #[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
    pub struct WalletProof {
        /// Proof to the whole database table.
        pub to_table: MapProof<Hash, Hash>,
        /// Proof to the specific wallet in this table.
        pub to_wallet: MapProof<PublicKey, Wallet>,
    }

    /// Wallet history.
    #[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
    pub struct WalletHistory {
        pub proof: ListProof<Hash>,
        pub transactions: Vec<WalletTransactions>,
    }
    ```

The following structure is what a user receives as
a response to his request. It is based on the previous auxiliary structures
and contains the information on
the wallet together with the
proofs of existence of the wallet and the correctness of its history.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct WalletInfo {
    pub block_proof: BlockProof,
    pub wallet_proof: WalletProof,
    pub wallet_history: Option<WalletHistory>,
}
```

### Retrieving Proof for Wallet

Now let’s define the method that will allow us to obtain information on a
particular wallet together with cryptographic
proof of its existence. The proofs also allow to confirm existence
of a particular transaction in the wallet history.

```rust
impl CryptocurrencyApi {
    pub fn wallet_info(
        state: &ServiceApiState,
        query: WalletQuery,
    ) -> api::Result<WalletInfo> {
        // implementation we elaborate further
    }
}
```

We create two schemas – one general schema of our
blockchain and the other one is the schema of our service described in the
relevant section above:

```rust
let snapshot = state.snapshot();
let general_schema = blockchain::Schema::new(&snapshot);
let currency_schema = CurrencySchema::new(&snapshot);
```

Secondly, we get the current height of our blockchain and obtain all the blocks
and their precommits to start building the proof:

```rust
let height = general_schema.height();
let block_proof = general_schema
    .block_and_precommits(height)
    .unwrap();
```

We then obtain the first part of the proof – from the state hash of our service
to the `Wallets` table:

```rust
let to_table: MapProof<Hash, Hash> = general_schema
    .get_proof_to_service_table(CRYPTOCURRENCY_SERVICE_ID, 0);
```

Note that we indicate `0` as the table identifier.
We use `0` here as the first (and only) element
in the array returned by the `state_hash` method of the service
corresponds to the root hash of the `Wallets` table.

Next, we fetch a proof of existence of a particular wallet inside the `Wallets`
table and include both parts of the proof into the `WalletProof` structure:

```rust
let to_wallet: MapProof<PublicKey, Wallet> =
    currency_schema.wallets().get_proof(query.pub_key);

let wallet_proof = WalletProof {
    to_table,
    to_wallet,
};
```

As a final step of this action we extract the proof for the wallet history.
Note, that the proof contains transaction hashes
rather than the transactions themselves. The transactions are stored
separately and are returned together with
the proof for user’s reference. This allows user to check correctness of the
provided proof.

We obtain the wallet history and the proof for all transaction hashes in it:

```rust
let wallet = currency_schema.wallet(&query.pub_key);

let wallet_history = wallet.map(|_| {
    let history = currency_schema.wallet_history(&query.pub_key);
    let proof = history.get_range_proof(0, history.len());
```

Next, we obtain transaction data for each history hash, transform them into the
readable format and output them in the form of an array:

```rust
    let transactions: Vec<WalletTransactions> = history
        .iter()
        .map(|hash| general_schema.transactions().get(&hash).unwrap())
        .map(|raw| WalletTransactions::tx_from_raw(raw).unwrap())
        .collect();

    WalletHistory {
        proof,
        transactions,
    }
});

Ok(WalletInfo {
    block_proof,
    wallet_proof,
    wallet_history,
})
```

We now have a complete proof for availability of a block in the blockchain, of a
certain wallet in the database and
said wallet’s history aggregated under the `WalletInfo` structure.

### Transaction API

The `post_transaction` defines the transactions processing logic.
It converts a transaction into our internal
Exonum-readable format and forwards it into the network. The user in his turn
receives back a hash of this transaction.

```rust
pub fn post_transaction(
    state: &ServiceApiState,
    query: WalletTransactions,
) -> api::Result<TransactionResponse> {
    let transaction: Box<dyn Transaction> = query.into();
    let tx_hash = transaction.hash();
    state.sender().send(transaction)?;
    Ok(TransactionResponse { tx_hash })
}
```

### Wiring API

Finally, we `wire` function and call the above-mentioned methods with it:

```rust
pub fn wire(builder: &mut ServiceApiBuilder) {
    builder
        .public_scope()
        .endpoint("v1/wallets/info", Self::wallet_info)
        .endpoint_mut("v1/wallets/transaction", Self::post_transaction);
}
```

## Running Service

We have now described all the structural parts of our demo. The last step is to
introduce the `main` function that will
launch the blockchain with our service:

```rust
fn main() {
    exonum::crypto::init();
    helpers::init_logger().unwrap();

    let node = NodeBuilder::new()
        .with_service(Box::new(configuration::ServiceFactory))
        .with_service(Box::new(cryptocurrency::ServiceFactory));
    node.run();
}
```

As soon as you launch the demo with the `cargo run` command, the `NodeBuilder`
will start to configure the network,
i.e. generate nodes, create their public and private keys, exchange keys between
nodes, etc. To learn how the network
is configured, please, consult
[the service documentation][demo].

Note that for the commands to work you need to use the name of your service
instead of `exonum-cryptocurrency-advanced`.
Or just use `cargo run` command instead of your crate name.

## Conclusion

Good job! You managed to set up, describe and launch an extended version of a
fully functional Exonum service!
